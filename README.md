Sleep Quality Assessment 

There are many different devices that claim to measure sleep quality. From fitness trackers to iPhone apps, there are a wide variety of techniques in use to make these measurements. However, there exists a difference between the data collected from an EEG compared to that collected from an iPhone microphone. The question that arises is how accurate are the different methods of assessing sleep quality? Can physiological signals and actigraphy collected from the Empatica E4 be used to create an algorithm to assess sleep quality?

In this project, I collect physiological data during sleep, create an algorithm to assess sleep quality, and compare it to commerically available systems.
